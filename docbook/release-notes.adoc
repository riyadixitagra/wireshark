= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 4.2.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

// Add a summary of major changes here.
// Add other changes to "New and Updated Features" below.

Windows installer file names now have the format Wireshark-<version>-<architecture>.exe.

Wireshark is now better about generating valid UTF-8 output.

A new display filter feature for filtering raw bytes has been added.

Display filter autocomplete is smarter about not suggesting invalid syntax.

The Windows build has a new SpeexDSP external dependency (https://www.speex.org).
The speex code that was previously bundled has been removed.

The personal extcap plugin folder location on Unix has been changed to
follow existing conventions for architecture-dependent files.
The extcap personal folder is now ``$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/extcap``.
Previously it was ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/extcap``.

The installation target no longer installs development headers by default.
That must be done explicitly using ``cmake --install <builddir> --component Development``.

The Wireshark installation is relocatable on Linux (and other ELF platforms
with support for relative RPATHs).

Support for building an NSIS Windows installer using the MinGW-w64 toolchain
and https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2]. Read README.msys2 in the distribution for more information.

When changing the dissector via the Decode As table for values that
have default dissectors registered, selecting "(none)" will select
no dissection (while still allowing heuristic dissectors to attempt to
dissect.) The previous behavior was to reset the dissector to the default.
To facilitate resetting the dissector, the default dissector is now sorted
at the top of the list of possible dissector options.

Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

* wsbuglink:18413[No Audio in RTP player with Wireshark 4.0.0] - RTP player do not play audio frequently on Win32 builds with Qt6

* wsbuglink:18510[Paused playback cannot continue to play] - Playback marker do not move after unpause with Qt6


//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark grabs your ID at 3 am, goes to Waffle House, and insults people.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 4.0.0:

// * The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.75.
//   They previously shipped with Npcap 1.71.

* The API has been updated to ensure that the dissection engine produces valid UTF-8 strings.

* Wireshark now builds with Qt6 by default. To use Qt5 instead pass USE_qt6=OFF to CMake.

* It is now possible to filter on raw packet data for any field by using the syntax ``@some.field == <bytes...>``.
  This can be useful to filter on malformed UTF-8 strings, among other use cases where it is necessary to
  look at the field's raw data.

* Negation (unary minus) now works with any display filter arithmetic expression.

* ciscodump support Cisco IOS XE 17.x

* The default interval between GUI updates when capturing has been decreased
from 500ms to 100ms, and is now configurable.

* The *-n* option also now disables IP address geolocation information lookup
in configured MaxMind databases (and geolocation lookup can be enabled with
*-Ng*.) This is most relevant for tshark, where geolocation lookups are
synchronous.

* Implement built-in dissector for FiRa UWB Controller Interface (UCI) protocol.
Recognizes PCAP traces with the link type LINKTYPE_FIRA_UCI=299.

* The reassemble_streaming_data_and_call_subdissector() API has been added to provide a simpler way to
  reassemble the streaming data of a high level protocol that is not on top of TCP.

* The display filter drop-down list is now sorted by "most recently used" instead
  of "most recently created".

* Running the test suite requires the https://pypi.org/project/pytest/[pytest]
  Python module. The emulation layer that allowed running tests without pytest
  installed has been removed.

* When saving files or exporting packets after changing their time with the
"Time Shift" dialog, the shifted time is written to the new file.

=== Updated Protocol Support

* The JSON dissector now has a preference to enable/disable "unescaping"
  of string values. By default it is off. Previously it was always on.

* The JSON dissector now supports "Display JSON in raw form".

* The IPv6 dissector has a new preference to show some semantic details
  about addresses (default off).

* The XML dissector now supports display character according to the "encoding"
  attribute of the XML declaration, and has a new preference to set default
  character encoding for some XML document without "encoding" attribute.

* The SIP dissector now has a new preference to set default charset for
  displaying the body of SIP messages in raw text view.

* The HTTP dissector now supports dissecting chunked data in streaming reassembly
  mode. Subdissectors of HTTP can register itself in "streaming_content_type"
  subdissector table for enabling streaming reassembly mode while transferring in
  chunked encoding. This feature ensures the server stream messages of GRPC-Web
  over HTTP/1.1 can be dissected even if the last chunk is absent.

* The media type dissector table now properly treats media types and subtypes
  as case-insensitive automatically, per RFC 6838. Media types no longer need
  to be lower cased before registering or looking up in the table.

* The CFM dissector has been overhauled and updated to the level of IEEE std
  802.1Q-2022 and ITU-T Rec. G.8013/Y.1371 (08/2015). This includes dissection
  of additional PDU types and TLVs as well as deeper dissection of existing PDUs
  and TLVs.

Too many other protocols have been updated to list them all here.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system specific to that platform.
A list of third-party packages can be found on the
